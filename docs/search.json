I’ve been fortunate to work with NFL teams, agents, and football analytics companies as a data provider and to have my work featured in FiveThirtyEight, The New York Times, and Football Outsiders.\nBut there’s more to me than just sports analytics! In my personal life, I’m passionate about:\n\nbeing Jewish (✡️and proud of it!)\nbeing the best uncle to my nephew (❤️you Judah!)\neating and making bagels (🥯of all kinds!)\nplaying guitar (electric and acoustic 🎸!)\nand exploring cities (on 🦶,🚋, 🚌, and in💻!)"
